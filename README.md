**NOTES:**
<br><br>

This is a R package for the implementation of MPSG approach (Meta-analysis model adapted for Pleiotropy Selection with Group structure). 

This method performs penalized multivariate meta-analysis method adapted for pleiotropy and take into account the group structure information nested in the data to select relevant variants and genes (or pathways) from all the genetic information.
